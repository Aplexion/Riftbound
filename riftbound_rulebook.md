626.1.d.4. If multiple Units have abilities or eects that require a player to assign them damage with the same priority, that player may assign damage to those units in any order.  
Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: two units with Tank ("I must be assigned combat damage first.") and one unit with no abilities. That player chooses one of the units with Tank and assigns combat damage to it. Then they must assign any remaining damage first to the other unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities.

627. The Resolution Step  
627.1. Remove Units with Lethal Damage marked on them.  
627.1.a. Reminder: Lethal Damage is nonzero damage equaling or exceeding the Might of a Unit.  
627.2. If both Attacking and Defending Units remain at the Battlefield, then Attacking Units are recalled.  
See rule 616. Recalls for more information.  
627.3. The Battlefield is Conquered if No Defending Units Remain but Attacking Units do remain.  
627.3.a. This results in an exchange of Control of this battlefield, which subsequently will cause a Conquer.  
See rule 179. Control for more information on Control.  
See rule 630.1 for more information on Conquering.  
627.4. Clear the Contested status from this Battlefield.  
627.5. Clear all marked damage from all Units at all Locations.

628. Perform a Cleanup.

629. Scoring  
630. A player Scores in one of two ways:  
630.1. Conquer: A player gains Control of a Battlefield they did not yet Score this turn.  
630.1.a. In Modes of Play with teammates, Battlefields under the Control of a teammate during the Beginning Phase are also disqualified from being Scored through Conquer by any means.  
630.2. Hold: A player has Control of a Battlefield during their Beginning Phase.

631. A player may only Score, from either method, once per Battlefield per turn.

632. When a player Scores, two things occur:  
632.1. The player earns up to one Point, depending on their current score.  
632.1.a. The Final Point has additional restrictions.  
632.1.a.1. Notably, points earned from sources that are not Conquer or Hold are not beholden to these restrictions.
